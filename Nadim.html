                    Studying ICT as always been a dream of mine even since i first saw a computer back in primary school .Growing up I grew more curios about computers and computer programs how the operate so  was always curios on how the  programs were created so that curiosity drove to choose the ICT program and also being software Engineer will give the skill to be able to creat my own softwares in the future. During my secondary and higher secondary schools ICT was on of my most favourite subject and i used to get good grades and enjoyed a lot studying programming languages. For all these reasons i have choosen ICT as my bachelor degree subject.
                    I choose to study at HZ in the Netherlands because its top quality education and practical approach of study and HZ is the 3rd best applied science university in the Netherlands
